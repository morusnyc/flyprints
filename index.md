Fly, aka Elen Orr, is a graphic artist and squatter who resides in the Lower East Side. Her arrival in the neighborhood coincided with the burgeoning 1980s squatting movement in which she established herself an artistic force by reproducing the essence of the community in her work. Fly’s art often explores the intersections of squat, punk, and feminist communities. She was a fixture at ABC No Rio and participated in the  World War 3 Illustrated collective. The Fly Zine Archive—a thirty-five year culmination made up of nearly 2,000 objects—is held by the Minneapolis Institute of Art. 

The collage prints on display are a selection from the Fly Prints Collection at the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space. They feature nine buildings which were part of the larger network of squats in the Lower East Side which by the 1990s which according to some estimates was made up of thirty-two buildings. 

Squatting was the result of spatial deconcentration which decimated the communities physical and social infrastructure. In the 1970s the federal government funded the development of urban homesteading organizations which promoted tenant rehabilitation, and eventual control, of city owned buildings. However, the exclusive nature of the homesteading programs along with the compounding growth of the unhoused population while city went on sealing what were viable housing options led others to create alternatives. 

In the mid 1980s a movement coalesced in which squatting a building—rather than seeking government funded homesteading projects—became a form of political action protesting the exploitative realities of the housing conditions of the neighborhood. The squatters fought for two decades to secure the claims to their homes. It is a story of building fires, riots, and weaponized human excrement at its most violent, and simultaneously it is the story of a quest for sustainability and equity in housing alternatives defined by companionship, creativity, and community resilience when provided a fair shake by historians. In 2002, eleven of the remaining squats inked a deal with the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) which secured legal ownership of the building s by their residents in exchange for one dollar and the value of the sweat equity of their work that went into the rehabilitation of the structures they squatted.

A selection of buildings that made up the squat network are memorialized through Fly’s art on display. The buildings evicted before the 2002 deal are indicated by Fly’s use of “RIP” in the title of the work. The former squats that remain as part of the deal with UHAB are now considered Housing Development Fund Corporation (HDFC) Co-Ops.
